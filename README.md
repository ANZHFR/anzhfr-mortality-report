# ANZHFR Mortality Report Analysis Pipeline

## Description

The Australian and New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry (ANZHFR) is a clinical quality registry that collects data about older people admitted to hospital with a broken hip in Australia and New Zealand. The registry is managed by a group clinicians and experts in the field with representation from a number of key professional organisations.
